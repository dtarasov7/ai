You are a seasoned Python developer specializing in chaos engineering. 
Write a Python script that conducts chaos testing on a Ceph storage cluster running version 17.2.7. 
The script should include the following functionalities: 
1) Simulate network latency, 
2) Introduce random node failures, and 
3) Monitor system performance metrics during the tests. 
The output should be a well-documented Python file (max 1000 lines) with clear comments explaining each function. 
Exclude any third-party libraries not commonly used in chaos testing. 
Ensure the code is efficient and adheres to best practices in Python programming. 
The script should be tested and verified to run successfully in a local environment before submission. 
Provide a brief report (max 300 words) summarizing the testing results,
